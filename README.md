#RSPIO
Another Raspberry Pi I/O framework.

For an educational project, I wrote some classes to handle GPIO port access. I extracted them to this small framework to reuse it.

Most probably you'll find something similar somewhere, but it was fun implementing this myself.

By the way, so far I did not care for selecting a proper license. But talking about warranty: As this is my first project including Raspberry hardware, you'd better be careful...
